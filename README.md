# Bionic Robotic-Arm: Binobo

#### Copyright (C) 2021 Dominik Lovetinsky, Philipp Maschayechi - This project is licenced under the MIT-Licence

This project aims at simulating a bionic robotic hand at as many degrees of freedom as possible.
In this source code, there is also the functionality of registration embedded as well as a blog functionality.

One thing you must consider when cloning this git repository is, that you have to add an `application.properties` file
at `src/main/resources/` with the following lines inserted:
```properties
# creates SPRING_SESSION db
spring.session.store-type=jdbc
spring.session.jdbc.initialize-schema=always

# setup MySQL Database
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/binobo_db?useUnicode=true&useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=<your-root-pw>
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
# this can be ommited
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect

# mail config for email-verification
# here you can also change this to any other smtp server
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your.email@something.co
spring.mail.password=<your-pw>
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true

# configuring ssl
server.ssl.key-store=keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=<PW_FROM_YOUR_CERTIFICATE>
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.ssl.keyAlias=binobo-diplomarbeit
```
You also must have MySQL-Server installed on your machine and before first starting the project, you must create a table called `binobo_db`. Once this is done, you are nearly ready to go!

To enable https, you have to generate an `ssl-certificate`:
```bash
keytool -genkeypair -alias binobo-diplomarbeit -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -storetype JKS -keystore springboot.jks -validity 3650 -storepass <PW_FROM_YOUR_CERTIFICATE>
```
**Run this command in the root directory of this project, and https is enabled.**

This project is completely open-source, so if you want to change anything in this source-code, just do so by creating a new branch and making a push-request.

Some parts of this code (HTML-Files) are written in german language, but will be changed soon to english as main-language.

#### Considering the fact, that this is meant to be a diploma work, we please everybody to not change the main propose of this project. This is also mentioned in our licence.
